Bug 1
Title: Negative numbers are not handled by the application

Steps to reproduce issue:
1. Enter a negative number in the text box to enter an integer.
2. Click "Calculate" button.
3. Observe that the app crashes with a 500 repsonse code.

Bug 2
Title: The placeholder text reads "Enter an integer", however factorials cannot be calculated on a negative number.

Description: Factorials can only be calculated on numbers >=0. Hence the placeholder text should rather read Enter a number greater than or equal to 0.

Bug 3:
Title: The page title has a typo "Factoriall"

Description: The page title should be called "Factorial" and not "Factoriall"
